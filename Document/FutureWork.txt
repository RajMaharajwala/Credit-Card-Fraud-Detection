With additional time devoted to tackling this challenge, I would consider implementing a more comprehensive and data-driven approach to enhance the credit fraud detection model. Here's an improved strategy:

- Exploring MICE for missing value imputation instead of mode by isFraud category.

- Trying out on various Data Transformation techniques on right skwed attributes

- Trying out on PCA (Principle Components Analysis) Dimensionality Reduction Technique.

- Statistical test among these features such as hypothesis testing, t-test, F-statisic etc

- Clustering for Data Segmentation: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to segment the data into meaningful clusters.
Use cluster labels as an additional feature for modeling.

- Fraud Trends: Identify temporal and transaction-related trends specific to fraudulent activities.

- Iterative Undersampling: For each cluster, perform iterative undersampling to balance the class distribution.
Undersample the majority class while maintaining diversity within the dataset.

- Model Selection and Tuning: For each cluster, explore a variety of classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines) with hyperparameter tuning.
Utilize techniques like cross-validation to find the best model configuration for each cluster.

- Testing and Ensemble: For a given test transaction, determine its cluster using the clustering model.
Apply the best-performing model from that cluster for fraud classification.

- Ensemble Strategies: Explore ensemble techniques (e.g., stacking) to combine predictions from different models.
Weight the predictions based on the performance of each model and the cluster it's associated with.

- Model Evaluation and Monitoring: Regularly evaluate models on validation and holdout sets to ensure generalization to unseen data. Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect model degradation or concept drift.

- Feature Engineering: Experiment with feature engineering techniques, such as creating time-based features, transaction frequency, and transaction value ratios.

Continuous Learning: Continuously update and refine the model as new data becomes available.
Keep exploring new techniques and research in fraud detection.
